# LROSE Science Gateway

### Background
This repository contains all the notebooks and parameter files for tutorials that will be hosted on the LROSE Science Gateway on Jetstream2.
The current tutorials will go over a few key LROSE workflows, showing how to use frequently used applications and highlighting key parameters. Tutorials can be downloaded after the workshop for use on a local machine, although paths may need to be edited. The tutorials are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

### Requirements

Running the tutorials on a local machine will require the Jupyter notebook interface. The notebooks are tested to run with the Topaz release of LROSE.
