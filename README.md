# AMS 2023 LROSE Workshop

### Background
This repository contains all the notebooks and parameter files for tutorials from the 2023 LROSE workshop before the AMS Annual Meeting in Denver, CO.
The tutorials will go over a few key LROSE workflows, showing how to use frequently used applications and highlighting key parameters. Tutorials can be downloaded after the workshop for use on a local machine, although paths may need to be edited. The tutorials are in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

### Requirements

All tutorials during the AMS workshop will run on a JupyterHub server provided by Unidata. All that is required is a laptop or tablet running a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) that can connect to the internet. 

Running the tutorials on a local machine will require the Jupyter notebook interface. The notebooks are tested to run with the Topaz release of LROSE.
